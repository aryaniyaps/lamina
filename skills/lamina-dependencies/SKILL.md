description: "Map prerequisite, data, lifecycle, and reachability dependencies between typed product-graph nodes, including explicit behavior when a dependency is unmet."

# Dependencies

Use top-level `dependencies[]` when one product behavior relies on another node. Dependencies prevent silent happy paths when setup, ownership, state, or another workflow is missing.

```json
{
  "id": "accept-requires-live-invite",
  "type": "prerequisite",
  "from": "workflow.accept-invite",
  "to": "entity.invitation",
  "required_state": "pending",
  "unmet_behavior": "Reject acceptance, explain expiry or prior use, and offer a new invitation path",
  "criticality": "critical",
  "source": "derived",
  "confidence": "high",
  "relevance_reason": "The workflow cannot succeed without a pending invitation"
}
```

## Procedure

1. Inspect every critical workflow and relationship.
2. Add only dependencies that change reachability, fidelity, lifecycle, or recovery.
3. Use typed `from` and `to` references.
4. State observable `unmet_behavior`; do not use vague precondition prose.
5. Add one scenario with a distinct `risk_key` when the unmet behavior materially affects the product.
6. During verification, force the unmet state and confirm the product blocks, degrades, or recovers exactly as contracted.

Avoid infrastructure/vendor dependencies unless they alter user-visible product behavior.
