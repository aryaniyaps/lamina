# Multi-View Integrity

One product, many actor views — each role sees what they need, but all views must agree on domain truth. Design handoffs and visibility across student, admin, exam cell, payment, and support paths.

## Decision frameworks

- **Actor view**: What this role sees, can do, and must not see — derived from permissions, not separate products.
  - When to use: Any product with more than one role.
  - How: `actors` in `run.yaml` + `personas.yaml` goals and permissions.

- **Frontstage vs backstage**: User-visible flow vs operations another role performs (student downloads ticket; exam cell assigns venue; payment gateway confirms fee).
  - When to use: Service-style workflows with handoffs.
  - How: Map workflow steps to owning actor; side effects on handoff.

- **Cross-view consistency check**: Same entity id, same lifecycle state, compatible fields across views (admin "cancelled" → student sees cancelled, not downloadable).

## Checklists

1. List all actors and their primary operations on each entity.
2. For each workflow, mark which actor performs each step.
3. Define what each actor sees after each state transition.
4. Write scenarios when views can disagree and how product resolves.
5. Verify phase: walk each actor path on live product.

## Anti-patterns

- **Split brain**: Admin voids ticket; student still downloads.
- **Leaked backstage**: Internal admin notes visible to students.
- **Orphan handoff**: Payment succeeds but ticket never unlocks — no actor owns the gap.

## Examples

- **Exam cell + student**: Exam cell publishes venue. Student ticket must show same venue. Invigilator roster lists students for that venue only. Scenarios — venue change after ticket issued triggers regen workflow and notification.
