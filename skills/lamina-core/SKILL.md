# Lamina Core — Problem Router

Load one capability skill per problem.

## Entry points

| Command | Use when |
|---------|----------|
| `/lamina` | Auto-route or single-topic answer |
| `/lamina-init` | Bootstrap domain charter |
| `/lamina-design` | Design how the product works → `ready_to_build` |
| `/lamina-verify` | Post-build or brownfield verification |

**Guardrail:** `.lamina/` writes only; never app source. See [guardrails.md](guardrails.md).

## Systems thinking (spine)

| Problem signal | Skill |
|----------------|-------|
| Entities, relationships, purpose | [system-structure](../lamina-system-structure/SKILL.md) |
| Feedback, delays, oscillation | [feedback-loops](../lamina-feedback-loops/SKILL.md) |
| Fixes keep failing, structural traps | [system-traps](../lamina-system-traps/SKILL.md) |
| Where to intervene (rules vs UI) | [leverage-points](../lamina-leverage-points/SKILL.md) |
| Impossible states, business rules | [invariants](../lamina-invariants/SKILL.md) |
| Domain boundaries, hide complexity | [modularity-boundaries](../lamina-modularity-boundaries/SKILL.md) |
| What users see when (stale data) | [consistency-guarantees](../lamina-consistency-guarantees/SKILL.md) |
| Double-submit, concurrent edits | [idempotency-concurrency](../lamina-idempotency-concurrency/SKILL.md) |

| Actors, roles, permissions | [user-modeling](../lamina-user-modeling/SKILL.md) |

## Agent simulation (replaces human research)

Human labs, interviews, and workshop ceremony are reframed as **contract + live-product simulation**.
