# Evidence Scoping (agent-native)

Before design or verify, list **what evidence exists** and what must be captured.

| Evidence | Source |
|----------|--------|
| Domain rules | User input, `business-context.md` |
| Existing UI | Repo `screens[].source`, walkthrough pack |
| Actor behavior | Verify actor walks on live product |
| Metrics | User-provided only — never invented |

Label each design claim: **verified**, **assumption**, or **to-verify**.

## Anti-patterns

- **Exhaustive research scope** — delaying contract without blocking gaps
- **Invented analytics** — fake A/B or usage data
