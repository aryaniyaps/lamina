# Decision Making (agent-native)

Rank **contract changes and verify findings** by impact on primary actor goals and invariants — output to `decisions.md` and sorted `findings[]`.

## Decision filter

Does this finding change a specific design or implementation decision? If not, dig deeper or drop.

## Impact × effort (verify findings)

| Impact | high | medium | low |
|--------|------|--------|-----|
| **Definition** | Blocks workflow, invariant violation, primary actor stuck | Friction with workaround | Polish |

| Effort | high | medium | low |
|--------|------|--------|-----|
| **Definition** | Cross-workflow contract change | Localized screen/scenario | Copy/label fix |

**Sort:** high impact + low effort first; then high impact + high effort. Record rationale in `decisions.md`.

## Primary actor filter

When actors conflict:
1. Does option serve **primary** persona goals completely?
2. If no → deprioritize or cut; if yes → design fully for their scenario.
3. Log trade-off in `decisions.md` with rejected actor impact noted.

Used when reconciling parallel persona panel outputs.

## Evidence weighting

| Source | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Invariant probe failure on live product | highest |
| Actor walk blocker (repro steps) | high |
| Walkthrough/repo grounding | medium |
| Assumption in design | low — mark `to-verify` |

Never rank invented analytics above reproduced actor failures.
