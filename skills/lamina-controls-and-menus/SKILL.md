# Controls and Actions (agent-native)

Specify **action semantics** in screen and workflow contracts — destructive, reversible, confirmation policy — not menu widget styling.

## Contract encoding

Per action on `screens[]`:
- `id`, `label`, `destructive: true|false`
- `reversible: true|false` → if true, confirmation usually unnecessary
- `confirmation_required` only when undo impossible + scenario documents
- `undo_scope`: step | session | none

Working-set actions on primary toolbar area in screen spec; full catalog in nav/menus.

## Frameworks

- **Ask forgiveness, not permission**: undo replaces confirm dialogs for recoverable ops.
- **Rich modeless feedback**: status in view, not modal for normalcy.
- **Preview/compare**: before irreversible-feeling changes — note in workflow step.

## Design checklists

1. Destructive ops have `scenarios[]` + recovery or undo policy.
2. Daily working-set actions ≤1-2 clicks from working screen.
3. Confirm only when invariant violation risk and undo absent.
4. Selection + manipulation pattern documented for sovereign apps.
5. Platform conventions noted in `implement.md` (web vs desktop) — Lamina stays unopinionated on library.

## Verify checks

- Actor walk: destructive op matches contract confirmation/undo behavior.
- Accidental click recovery — undo or cancel path exists per contract.

## Anti-patterns

- Confirm dialog for undoable delete.
- Modal error for recoverable validation.
- All actions equal weight on crowded screen spec.
- Hidden working-set functions three levels deep.
