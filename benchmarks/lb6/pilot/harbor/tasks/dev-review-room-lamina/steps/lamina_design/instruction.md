# dev-review-room — lamina design

Use the installed Lamina skills and slash commands fully. Follow Mode B: during `/lamina-*` commands write only under `.lamina/`; implement application source in separate coding turns. Do not skip persona-panel native Task children, risk-skill loads, or authority/lifecycle modeling because this is a development pilot — those are part of how Lamina works.

Run **only** `/lamina-design` via the `lamina-design` skill end-to-end through `ready_to_build` with `implement.md`. Spawn **≥2 native Task persona children** during design — do not inline-fake the panel in parent text when Task is available.

## Lamina development pilot profile

- Contract stage: start from **`shape`**. Model authority, privacy, and lifecycle boundaries in `reduce`/`project`.
- Delivery posture: in-memory reducer + HTML UI in `/app`.
- Design must run the persona-panel via native Task children before `ready_to_build`.
- Mode B: during `/lamina-*` write only `.lamina/`; implement app source in coding turns.
## Required native persona Task children

Spawn **≥2 materially distinct personas** using Cursor's native Task/subagent tool (`taskToolCall`), not parent-authored simulation. Each child must run on requested `composer-2.5`. Preserve child `agentId`, success, duration, and conversation steps in the run record.

## Development-only persona provenance envelope

This pilot accepts Cursor native `taskToolCall` metadata in the parent session when independent child `system.init` events are unavailable:

- parent `system.init.model = Composer 2.5`
- native `taskToolCall` with child `agentId`
- requested child model `composer-2.5`
- successful completion, duration, and conversation steps

Record `child_actual_model_unverified: true`. This pilot cannot satisfy the claim-ready LaminaBench-6 native-child contract.


## Founder brief

# Lightweight document review

I want a small product where someone can invite a trusted person to review one document and leave useful comments. It should feel safe and focused rather than like giving away access to a whole workspace. Please shape the product and build the next coherent version.
